# Document-Classification-Dataset
A dataset containing text from a variety of document classes for classification and demonstration purposes.

For anyone who has ever had to set up and demo a document classification system, You know that generating a dataset of documents in specific classes is time-consuming and often of a poor quality (Copy pasting the same set of few documents over and over again until the classifier is happy).

This project is an effort to create a high-quality classification dataset containing a variety of document classes for everyone to use and add to.
The goal is to reach about 100 different samples of each document class for training and a smaller set for validation or demonstration.

## How to contribute
This description, along with the rest of this readme, is to be ellaborated. 
Essentially, adding to this project requires documents to be in **English** as well as anonymized.
Merging documents into the repository can be done via a Pull-request or by sending them straight to Solution Management.

The plan is to also have a script that automatically fills in a set of "Customer" names and up-to-date dates within a range, to make the data more relevant.
The exact details of this script and how things should be stored and processed is yet to be determined.
